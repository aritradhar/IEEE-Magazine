{\bfseries
Secure enclave architectures have become prevalent in modern CPUs and hardware-protected enclaves provide a flexible way to implement various security services. But in certain cases special-purpose security chips still have advantages. Interestingly, dedicated security chips can also assist enclaves in their operation and improve the security of enclaves.}
